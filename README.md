Overview
--------
VR Pacman is a virtual reality spin on the classic 1980s Pac-man game by Namco. In VR Pacman, you become the Pac-man in this first-person maze traversing game. Users can compete in ranked games or play in custom private games with their friends. They can also design or purchase their own virtual reality mazes and share them to the world. This game is meant for both mobile (virtual reality) and Desktop (360 degree camera).

# Controls
Collect as many pellets as possible while avoiding the ghost coming after you.

  * **Turn Your VR Headset** - for mobile VR
  * **Mouse Click and Drag** - for desktop

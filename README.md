Bringing the timeless arcade game, PacMan, to a Virtual Reality platform where users experience an immersive first person challenge reminiscent of the original PacMan. 



Demos
-----

**[A live demo is available](http://www.vrpacman.com)


Overview
--------
Built on babylon.js, a complete JavaScript framework for building 3D games with HTML5, WebGL and Web Audio.  

# Controls
Collect as many pellets as possible while avoiding the many ghosts that are coming after you.    

  * **Turn Your VR Headset** - Move your ninja rabbit on the map.
  * **Mouse Click and Drag** - Hold down to pull a carrot from the ground. You need to be close to a carrot.
